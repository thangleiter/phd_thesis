- move OU-process and discussion of $S(\omega)$ properties to beggining of chapter?
    - motivation for some things become clear only after
    - requires definitions, including $f_\mathrm{S}$ and $\Delta t$
- explain spectral leakage, scalloping loss, give quantitative estimate
- fewer sidenotes / move into text
- is it clear enough why windowing and Welch are required?
- show Welch result for ideal overlap?

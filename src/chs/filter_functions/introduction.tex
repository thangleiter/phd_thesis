Parts of the results presented in this part have been published in \citerr{Cerfontaine2021}{Hangleiter2021}.
In~\citer{Hangleiter2021}, extensive use was made of \citeauthor{Kubo1962}'s \emph{cumulant expansion}.
Due to an error in \citeauthor{Kubo1962}'s paper which was only pointed out several years later \sidecite{Fox1976} and the authors were not aware of, those results turned out to be not exact as claimed but approximate \sidecite{Hangleiter2024}.
We investigate the accuracy of the expansion in \cref{ch:filter_functions:validation}.

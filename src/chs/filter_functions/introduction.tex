Parts of the results presented in this part have been published in \citerr{Cerfontaine2021}{Hangleiter2021}.
In~\citer{Hangleiter2021}, extensive use was made of \citeauthor{Kubo1962}'s \emph{cumulant expansion}.
Due to an error in \citeauthor{Kubo1962}'s paper which was only pointed out several years later \sidecite{Fox1976} and we were not aware of, those results turned out to be not exact as claimed but approximate \sidecite{Hangleiter2024}.
\marginnote{
    Unfortunately, the error has proliferated through the literature and proves quite pervasive despite the significant amount of time that has passed since it was first discovered.
    Recent examples include~\citer{Norris2016}.
    One may only speculate if this is because of the 14 years that passed between the original publication and the correction, the lack of an erratum once the mistake had been discovered, or simply because of \citeauthor{Kubo1962}'s fame.
    In any case, it might serve as a cautionary tale and possibly an impetus to a less static publication system that allows, for example, cross-linking commentaries and critiques.

We investigate the accuracy of the expansion in \cref{ch:ff:validation}.

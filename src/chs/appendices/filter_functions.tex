\chapter{Filter Functions}\label{ch:appendix:filter_functions}
\section{Second-order concatenation}\label{sec:appendix:concatenation}
In this appendix, I lay out how the second-order filter functions of atomic pulse segments can be re-used to compute the filter function of the concatenated sequence.
While it is not possible, due to the nested time integral\todo{refeq}, to perform the calculation entirely without concern for the internal structure of the individual segments, it is also not necessary to compute everything from scratch.

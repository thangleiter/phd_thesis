  abstract = {Calibration of quantum gates is a necessary hurdle to overcome on the way to a reliable quantum computer. In a recent paper, a protocol called Gate Set Calibration protocol (GSC) has been introduced and used to learn coherent errors from multi-qubit quantum gates. Here, we extend this study in a number of ways: First, we perform a statistical analysis of the measurement uncertainties. Second, we find explicit measurement settings that minimize this uncertainty, while also requiring that the protocol involves only a small number of distinct gates, aiding physical realizability. We numerically demonstrate that, just by adding two more single-qubit gates to GSC, the statistical error produced in the calibration of a CNOT gate is divided by a factor of more than two.},

  abstract = {Many qubit implementations are afflicted by correlated noise not captured by standard theoretical tools that are based on Markov approximations. While independent gate operations are a key concept for quantum computing, it is actually not possible to fully describe noisy gates locally in time if noise is correlated on times longer than their duration. To address this issue, we develop a method based on the filter function formalism to perturbatively compute quantum processes in the presence of correlated classical noise. We derive a composition rule for the filter function of a sequence of gates in terms of those of the individual gates. The joint filter function allows to efficiently compute the quantum process of the whole sequence. Moreover, we show that correlation terms arise which capture the effects of the concatenation and thus yield insight into the effect of noise correlations on gate sequences. Our generalization of the filter function formalism enables both qualitative and quantitative studies of algorithms and state-of-the-art tools widely used for the experimental verification of gate fidelities like randomized benchmarking, even in the presence of noise correlations.},

  abstract = {Cryogenic confocal microscopy is a powerful method for studying solid state quantum devices such as single photon sources and optically controlled qubits. While the vast majority of such studies have been conducted at temperatures of a few Kelvin, experiments involving fragile quantum effects often require lower operating temperatures. To also allow for electrical dynamic control, microwave connectivity is required. For polarization-sensitive studies, free space optical access is advantageous compared to fiber coupling. Here we present a confocal microscope in a dilution refrigerator providing all the above features at temperatures below 100 mK. The installed high frequency cabling meets the requirements for state-of-the-art spin qubit experiments. As another unique advantage of our system, the sample fitting inside a large puck can be exchanged while keeping the cryostat cold with minimal realignment. Assessing the performance of the instrument, we demonstrate confocal imaging, sub-nanosecond modulation of the emission wavelength of a suitable sample, and an electron temperature of 76 mK. While the instrument was constructed primarily with the development of optical interfaces to electrically controlled qubits in mind, it can be used for many experiments involving quantum transport, solid state quantum optics, and microwave-optical transducers.},

  abstract = {Combining the capabilities of gate-defined quantum transport devices in GaAs-based heterostructures and of optically addressed self-assembled quantum dots could open up broad perspectives in quantum technologies. For example, interfacing stationary solid-state qubits with photonic quantum states would open up a pathway towards the realization of a quantum network with extended quantum processing capacity in each node. While gated devices allow very flexible confinement of electrons or holes, the confinement of excitons without some element of self-assembly is much harder. To address this limitation, we introduce a technique to realize exciton traps in quantum wells via local electric fields by thinning a heterostructure down to a 220-nm-thick membrane. We show that mobilities over 1×106cm2V−1s−1 can be retained and that quantum point contacts and Coulomb oscillations can be observed on this structure, which implies that the thinning does not compromise the heterostructure quality. Furthermore, the local lowering of the exciton energy via the quantum-confined Stark effect is confirmed, thus forming exciton traps. These results lay the technological foundations for devices like single-photon sources, spin-photon interfaces and eventually quantum network nodes in GaAs quantum wells, realized entirely with a top-down fabrication process.},

  abstract = {Operating semiconductor quantum dots as quantum bits requires isolating single electrons by adjusting gate voltages. The transitions of electrons to and from the dots appear as a honeycomb-like pattern in recorded charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Thus, detecting the pattern is essential to tune a double dot, but manual tuning is seriously time-consuming. However, automation of this process is difficult because the transitions’ contrast is often low, and noise and background disorder potential shifts disturb the CSDs. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio needs to be increased to improve the detection of the line pattern. For this purpose, we evaluate a representative set of edge-preserving smoothing filters and compare them both quantitatively and qualitatively by suitable metrics and visual assessment. We generate artificial data to use full-reference metrics for the evaluation procedure and to optimize the filter parameters. Based on the results of this article, the methods attain a moderate to good amount of noise reduction and structure improvement dependent on the different CSD qualities. In conclusion, we suggest introducing the block-matching and three-dimensional transform-domain filter into the automated tuning processing pipeline. If the data are corrupted by significant amounts of random telegraph noise, the bilateral filter and the rolling guidance filter are also good choices.},

  abstract = {In gate-defined quantum dot systems, the conductance change of electrostatically coupled sensor dots allows the observation of the quantum dots' charge and spin states. Therefore, the sensor dot must be optimally sensitive to changes in its electrostatic environment. A series of conductance measurements varying the two sensor-dot-forming barrier gate voltages serve to tune the dot into a corresponding operating regime. In this article, we analyze the noise characteristics of the measured data and define a criterion to identify continuous regions with a sufficient signal-gradient-to-noise ratio. Hence, accurate noise estimation is required when identifying the optimal operating regime. Therefore, we evaluate several existing noise estimators, modify them for 1-D data, optimize their parameters, and analyze their quality based on simulated data. The estimator of Chen et al. turns out to be best suited for our application concerning minimally scattering results. Furthermore, using this estimator in an algorithm for flank-of-interest classification in measured data shows the relevance and applicability of our approach.},

  abstract = {Autocorrelated noise appears in many solid-state qubit systems and hence needs to be taken into account when developing gate operations for quantum information processing. However, explicitly simulating this kind of noise is often less efficient than approximate methods. Here, we focus on the filter function formalism, which allows the computation of gate fidelities in the presence of autocorrelated classical noise. Hence, this formalism can be combined with optimal control algorithms to design control pulses, which optimally implement quantum gates. To enable the use of gradient-based algorithms with fast convergence, we present analytically derived filter function gradients with respect to control pulse amplitudes, and analyze the computational complexity of our results. When comparing pulse optimization using our derivatives to a gradient-free approach, we find that the gradient-based method is roughly 2 orders of magnitude faster for our test cases. We also provide a modular computational implementation compatible with quantum optimal control packages.},

  abstract = {Efficient interconnection between distant semiconductor spin qubits with the help of photonic qubits offers exciting new prospects for future quantum communication applications. In this paper, we optimize the extraction efficiency of a novel interface between a singlet-triplet-spin-qubit and a photonic-qubit. The interface is based on a 220-nm-thick Ga⁢As/(Al,Ga)⁢As heterostructure membrane and consists of a gate-defined double quantum dot (GDQD) supporting a singlet-triplet qubit, an optically active quantum dot (OAQD) consisting of a gate-defined exciton trap, a photonic crystal cavity providing in-plane optical confinement, efficient outcoupling to an ideal free-space Gaussian beam while accommodating the gate wiring of the GDQD and OAQD, and a bottom gold reflector to recycle photons and increase the optical extraction efficiency. All the essential components can be lithographically defined and deterministically fabricated on the Ga⁢As/(Al,Ga)⁢As heterostructure membrane, which greatly increases the scalability of on-chip integration. According to our simulations, the interface provides an overall coupling efficiency of 28.7\% into a free-space Gaussian beam, assuming a Si⁢O2 interlayer fills the space between the reflector and the membrane. The performance can be further increased by undercutting this Si⁢O2 interlayer below the photonic crystal. In this case, the overall efficiency is calculated to be 48.5\%.},

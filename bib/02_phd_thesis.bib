  abstract = {Decoherence is one of the most important obstacles that must be overcome in quantum information processing. It depends on the qubit-environment coupling strength, but also on the spectral composition of the noise generated by the environment. If the spectral density is known, fighting the effect of decoherence can be made more effective. Applying sequences of inversion pulses to the qubit system, we generate effective filter functions that probe the environmental spectral density. Comparing different pulse sequences, we recover the complete spectral density function and distinguish different contributions to the overall decoherence.},

  abstract = {Manipulating quantum computing hardware in the presence of imperfect devices and control systems is a central challenge in realizing useful quantum computers. Susceptibility to noise limits the performance and capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, as well as any future quantum computing technologies. Fortunately quantum control enables efficient execution of quantum logic operations and algorithms with built-in robustness to errors, without the need for complex logical encoding. In this manuscript we introduce software tools for the application and integration of quantum control in quantum computing research, serving the needs of hardware R\&D teams, algorithm developers, and end users. We provide an overview of a set of python-based classical software tools for creating and deploying optimized quantum control solutions at various layers of the quantum computing software stack. We describe a software architecture leveraging both high-performance distributed cloud computation and local custom integration into hardware systems, and explain how key functionality is integrable with other software packages and quantum programming languages. Our presentation includes a detailed mathematical overview of central product features including a flexible optimization toolkit, filter functions for analyzing noise susceptibility in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and new approaches to noise and hardware characterization. Pseudocode is presented in order to elucidate common programming workflows for these tasks, and performance benchmarking is reported for numerically intensive tasks, highlighting the benefits of the selected cloud-compute architecture. Finally, we present a series of case studies demonstrating the application of quantum control solutions using these tools in real experimental settings for both trapped-ion and superconducting quantum computer hardware.},

Here, we extend this formalism to account for more general types of noise that couple to the qubit through terms that do not commute with the qubit's bare Hamiltonian. Our approach applies to any power spectrum that generates slow noise fluctuations in the qubit's evolution. We demonstrate our formalism in the case of singlet-triplet qubits subject to both quasistatic nuclear noise and \$1/\textbackslash omega\textasciicircum\textbackslash alpha\$ charge noise and find good agreement with recent experimental findings. This comparison shows the efficacy of our approach in describing real systems and additionally highlights the challenges with distinguishing different types of noise in free induction decay experiments.},

Kendall made the pertinent observation that the smoothing of periodograms obtained from autoregressive or other time-series with continuous spectra is equivalent to considering the first few sample autocorrelations. I had arrived at a similar conclusion, though possibly by an alternative route, having noticed that the averaging of periodograms obtained from contiguous lengths of series is approximately equivalent to a truncation of the correlogram at a point represented by the length of the subseries. From preliminary computation already made on M. G. Kendall‘s artificial series to test out this smoothing device, it appears promising.},

Recent experiments have demonstrated multi-qubit quantum processors, optical interconnects, and basic quantum error correction protocols. One of the key open challenges towards larger-scale systems is to realize high-fidelity universal quantum gates. In this work, we design and demonstrate a complete high-fidelity gate set for the two-qubit system formed by the electron and nuclear spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We use gate set tomography (GST) to systematically optimise the gates and demonstrate single-qubit gate fidelities of up to \$99.999(1)\textbackslash\%\$ and a two-qubit gate fidelity of \$99.93(5) \textbackslash\%\$. Our gates are designed to decouple unwanted interactions and can be extended to other electron-nuclear spin systems. The high fidelities demonstrated provide new opportunities towards larger-scale quantum processing with colour-center qubits.},

We find distinct power-law dependencies of T2 and α on temperature depending on the nature of the interaction of the fluctuators with the associated bath. We consider fluctuator dynamics induced by first- and second-order tunneling with a continuum of delocalized electron states. We also study one- and two-phonon processes for fluctuators in either GaAs or Si. These results can be used to identify dominant charge-dephasing mechanisms and suppress them.},

  abstract = {More than fifty years ago, in a couple of seminal works Kubo introduced the important idea of generalized cumulants, extending to stochastic operators this concept, implicitly introduced by Laplace in 1810. Kubo's idea has been applied in several branches of physics, where the result of the average process is a Lioville operator or an effective time evolution operator for the density matrix of spin systems or the reduced density matrix for boson-fermions etc. Despite this success, the theoretical developments in these Kubo works pose problems that were highlighted many years ago by Fox and van Kampen and never solved. These weaknesses and errors, in particular concerning the factorization property of exponentials of cumulants and the explicit expressions that give generalized cumulants in terms of generalized moments and vice-versa, caused some perplexity (and confusion) about the possible application of this procedure, limiting its use, in practice. In the present paper, we give a sound ground to the approach to cumulant operators, working in a general framework that shows the potentiality of the old Kubo's idea, today not yet fully exploited. It results that for the same moment operators, different definitions of generalized cumulants can be adopted. A general Kubo-Meeron closed-form formula giving cumulant operators in terms of moment operators cannot be obtained, but the reverse one, cumulants in terms of operators, is given and, noticeably, formally it \{\textbackslash em does not\} depend on the specific nature of the moments, but just on the definition of the generalized cumulants.},

  abstract = {Any quantum system, such as those used in quantum information or magnetic resonance, is subject to random phase errors that can dramatically affect the fidelity of a desired quantum operation or measurement. In the context of quantum information, quantum error correction techniques have been developed to correct these errors, but resource requirements are extraordinary. The realization of a physically tractable quantum information system will therefore be facilitated if qubit (quantum bit) error rates are far below the so-called fault-tolerance error threshold, predicted to be of the order of 10(-3)-10(-6). The need to realize such low error rates motivates a search for alternative strategies to suppress dephasing in quantum systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate massive suppression of qubit error rates by the application of optimized dynamical decoupling pulse sequences, using a model quantum system capable of simulating a variety of qubit technologies. We demonstrate an analytically derived pulse sequence, UDD, and find novel sequences through active, real-time experimental feedback. The latter sequences are tailored to maximize error suppression without the need for a priori knowledge of the ambient noise environment, and are capable of suppressing errors by orders of magnitude compared to other existing sequences (including the benchmark multi-pulse spin echo). Our work includes the extension of a treatment to predict qubit decoherence under realistic conditions, yielding strong agreement between experimental data and theory for arbitrary pulse sequences incorporating nonidealized control pulses. These results demonstrate the robustness of qubit memory error suppression through dynamical decoupling techniques across a variety of qubit technologies.},

But since qubits are noisy and error-prone, they will depend on fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) to compute reliably. Quantum error correction can protect against general noise if—and only if—the error in each physical qubit operation is smaller than a certain threshold. The threshold for general errors is quantified by their diamond norm. Until now, qubits have been assessed primarily by randomized benchmarking, which reports a different error rate that is not sensitive to all errors, and cannot be compared directly to diamond norm thresholds.

The fundamentals of density matrix theory, quantum Markov processes, and completely positive dynamical semigroups are developed. The most important master equations used in quantum optics and condensed matter theory are derived and applied to the study of many examples. Special attention is paid to the Markovian and non-Markovian theory of environment induced decoherence, its role in the dynamical description of the measurement process, and to the experimental observation of decohering electromagnetic field states. The book includes the modern formulation of open quantum systems in terms of stochastic processes in Hilbert space. Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics. The fundamentals of the treatment of non-Markovian quantum processes in open systems are developed on the basis of various mathematical techniques, such as projection superoperator methods and influence functional techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and the density matrix theory of relativistic quantum electrodynamics.},

This method for preventing errors in quantum information processors is treated here in a geometric setting which leads to an intuitive perspective. Using this geometric description, we clarify the notion of group symmetrization as an averaging technique, and provide a geometric picture for evaluating errors due to imperfect bang-bang controls. This will provide additional support for the usefulness of such controls as a means for providing more reliable quantum information processing.},

Most of this progress is based on microwave control of single spins in devices made of isotopically purified silicon. For controlling spins, the exchange interaction is an additional key ingredient which poses new challenges for high-fidelity control. Here, we demonstrate exchange-based single-qubit gates of two-electron spin qubits in GaAs double quantum dots. Using careful pulse optimization and closed-loop tuning, we achieve a randomized benchmarking fidelity of (99.50±0.04)\% and a leakage rate of 0.13\% out of the computational subspace. These results open new perspectives for microwave-free control of singlet-triplet qubits in GaAs and other materials.},

Unlike errors from decoherence, systematic errors can in principle be completely removed by tuning experimental parameters. Here, we present an iterative calibration routine which can remove systematic gate errors on several qubits. A central ingredient is the construction of pulse sequences that extract independent indicators for every linearly independent error generator. We show that decoherence errors only moderately degrade the achievable infidelity due to systematic errors. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence properties of our approach by performing simulations for a specific qubit encoded in a pair of spins. Our results indicate that a gate set with 230 gate parameters can be calibrated in about ten iterations, after which incoherent errors limit the gate fidelity.},

While independent gate operations are a key concept for quantum computing, it is actually not possible to fully describe noisy gates locally in time if noise is correlated on times longer than their duration. To address this issue, we develop a method based on the filter function formalism to perturbatively compute quantum processes in the presence of correlated classical noise. We derive a composition rule for the filter function of a sequence of gates in terms of those of the individual gates. The joint filter function allows to efficiently compute the quantum process of the whole sequence. Moreover, we show that correlation terms arise which capture the effects of the concatenation and thus yield insight into the effect of noise correlations on gate sequences. Our generalization of the filter function formalism enables both qualitative and quantitative studies of algorithms and state-of-the-art tools widely used for the experimental verification of gate fidelities like randomized benchmarking, even in the presence of noise correlations.},

In this paper, a general treatment of the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects is presented which is valid for an arbitrary system-environment model in the weak system-environment coupling regime. It is shown that the effective lifetime of a quantum state that is subjected to repeated projective measurements depends on the overlap of the spectral density of the environment and a generalized 'filter function'. This filter function depends on the system-environment Hamiltonian, the state of the environment, and the measurement being performed. Our general framework is then used to study explicitly the Zeno to anti-Zeno crossover behaviour for the spin-boson model where a single two-level system is coupled to a bosonic environment. It is possible to not only reproduce results for the usual population decay case as well as for the pure dephasing model, but to also study the regime where both decay and dephasing take place. These results are then extended to many two-level systems coupled collectively to the bosonic environment to further illustrate the importance of the correct evaluation of the effective decay rate.},

  abstract = {Interfacing stationary matter qubits with flying photonic qubits is of major interest in quantum computing and quantum communication technology as it is a necessary requirement to create a distributed quantum computer or a quantum network. Assuming a spin-based stationary qubit, Gallium-Arsenide (GaAs) spin qubit in gate-defined quantum dots (GDQD) would be a promising candidate for a spin-photon interface as the direct bandgap of GaAs allows interaction with light. However, as the confinement in GDQD results from electrostatic potentials, either holes or electrons can be confined but not jointly. Since the spin of the photo-electron is entangled with the spin of the photo-hole after photon absorption, the loss of the latter would lead to decoherence of the former. To provide a coherent transfer of information between the spin qubit and the photonic qubit, one solution is to modify the conventional heterostructure and gate architecture to embed an exciton trap as an intermediary. In this thesis, we implement the exciton trap by including a quantum well (QW) in the heterostructure and by patterning two local metal gates vertically aligned on both sides of the heterostructure. The QW provides the confinement along the growth direction while an electric field applied between the opposite metal gates confines the exciton in-plane by the quantum-confined Stark effect. Patterning these gates on the two sides of the 220 nm heterostructure involves a demanding fabrication process as the substrate has to be removed. To characterize the devices, a dilution refrigerator was customized to enable spin qubit and photoluminescence measurements at millikelvin temperatures. As a first approach to accumulate the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the QW needed to form GDQD, double-side doping of the barriers was considered. Hall measurements showed that a high mobility electron gas (above 106 cm2/(Vs)) can still be obtained on a thinned heterostructure. Quantum point contacts and single GDQD can also be formed. The thin doped heterostructure showed the photoluminescence expected from a QW filled with electrons populating the lowest sub-band of the 2DEG. The formation of an exciton trap by the quantum-confined Stark effect with top and bottom local gates is also possible provided depletion of the 2DEG underneath the trapping gates. Although the doped heterostructure demonstrated the basic prerequisites to create the aforementioned spin-photon interface, the undesired optical excitations of the DX centers added to the poor material quality pushed for the development of a second approach based on dopant-free heterostructures. On undoped heterostructure, the photoluminescence properties of exciton traps with a global grown back-gate were first investigated to reproduce already-known behaviors.},

For example, interfacing stationary solid-state qubits with photonic quantum states would open up a pathway towards the realization of a quantum network with extended quantum processing capacity in each node. While gated devices allow very flexible confinement of electrons or holes, the confinement of excitons without some element of self-assembly is much harder. To address this limitation, we introduce a technique to realize exciton traps in quantum wells via local electric fields by thinning a heterostructure down to a 220-nm-thick membrane. We show that mobilities over 1×106cm2V−1s−1 can be retained and that quantum point contacts and Coulomb oscillations can be observed on this structure, which implies that the thinning does not compromise the heterostructure quality. Furthermore, the local lowering of the exciton energy via the quantum-confined Stark effect is confirmed, thus forming exciton traps. These results lay the technological foundations for devices like single-photon sources, spin-photon interfaces and eventually quantum network nodes in GaAs quantum wells, realized entirely with a top-down fabrication process.},

  abstract = {Cryogenic confocal microscopy is a powerful method for studying solid state quantum devices such as single photon sources and optically controlled qubits. While the vast majority of such studies have been conducted at temperatures of a few Kelvin, experiments involving fragile quantum effects often require lower operating temperatures. To also allow for electrical dynamic control, microwave connectivity is required. For polarization-sensitive studies, free space optical access is advantageous compared to fiber coupling. Here we present a confocal microscope in a dilution refrigerator providing all the above features at temperatures below 100 mK. The installed high frequency cabling meets the requirements for state-of-the-art spin qubit experiments. As another unique advantage of our system, the sample fitting inside a large puck can be exchanged while keeping the cryostat cold with minimal realignment. Assessing the performance of the instrument, we demonstrate confocal imaging, sub-nanosecond modulation of the emission wavelength of a suitable sample, and an electron temperature of 76 mK. While the instrument was constructed primarily with the development of optical interfaces to electrically controlled qubits in mind, it can be used for many experiments involving quantum transport, solid state quantum optics, and microwave-optical transducers.},

  abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent one of the most vital theoretical aspects of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large-scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large-scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. The development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},

By expanding standard randomized benchmarking analysis to this experimental regime, we find that such nonexponential decays are better modeled by multiple exponential decay rates, leading to an instantaneous control fidelity for isotopically purified silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum-dot qubits which is 98.9\% when the low-frequency noise causes large detuning but can be as high as 99.9\% when the qubit is driven on resonance and system calibrations are favorable. These advances in qubit characterization and validation methods underpin the considerable prospects for silicon as a qubit platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

  abstract = {In this manuscript we address the problem of deriving \textbackslash emph\{analytic\} expressions for calculating universal decoherence-induced errors in qubits undergoing arbitrary, unitary, time-dependent quantum-control protocols. For a qubit undergoing unitary decoherence the evolution of a qubit state in the presence of time-varying semiclassical fields may be treated geometrically. We show that the fidelity of an arbitrary control operation may then be expressed to arbitrary order in terms of experimentally relevant spectral characteristics of the noise and the control over all Cartesian directions and accounting for noise cross-correlations. We formulate \textbackslash emph\{control matrices\} in the time domain to capture the effects of piecewise-constant control, and convert them to generalized Fourier-domain filter functions. Such generalized filter functions may therefore be derived for complex temporally modulated control protocols, accounting for susceptibility to rotations of the qubit state vector in three dimensions. Taken together, this framework provides a computationally efficient means to calculate the effects of universal noise on arbitrary quantum control protocols without the need for time-consuming simulations of Bloch vector evolution. As a concrete example, we apply our method to treating the problem of dynamical decoupling incorporating realistic control pulses of arbitrary duration or form, including the replacement of simple \$\textbackslash pi\$-pulses with complex dynamically corrected gates.},

In contrast to quantum process tomography (QPT), GST self-consistently and correctly accounts for state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. It therefore provides significantly more accurate estimates than QPT as gate fidelities increase into the fault-tolerant regime. We give a detailed review of GST and provide a self-contained guide to its implementation. The method is presented in a step-by-step fashion and relevant mathematical background material is included. Our goal is to demonstrate the utility of GST as both an accurate characterization technique and a simple and effective diagnostic tool. As an illustration, we compare the output of GST and QPT using simulated example data for a single qubit. In agreement with the original literature, we find that coherent errors are poorly estimated by QPT near quantum error correction thresholds, while GST is accurate in this regime.},

  abstract = {Intense radiofrequency power in the form of pulses is applied to an ensemble of spins in a liquid placed in a large static magnetic Geld H\&. The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisGes the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in Ho. At times de- termined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and ac- curately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measure- ments of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

For a given bipartite state acting on \$C\textasciicircum d\textbackslash otimes C\textasciicircum d\$ we have \$f\_\{max\}= \{F\_\{max\}d+1\textbackslash over d+1\}\$. We assume completely general teleportation scheme (trace preserving LQCC action over the pair and the third particle in unknown state). The proof involves the isomorphism between quantum channels and a class of bipartite states. We also exploit the technique of \$U\textbackslash otimes U\textasciicircum *\$ twirling states (random application of unitary transformation of the above form) and the introduced analogous twirling of channels. We illustrate the power of the theorem by showing that \{\textbackslash it any\} bound entangled state does not provide better fidelity of teleportation than for the purely classical channel. Subsequently, we apply our tools to the problem of the so-called conclusive teleportation, then reduced to the question of optimal conclusive increasing of singlet fraction. We provide an example of state for which Alice and Bob have no chance to obtain perfect singlet by LQCC action, but still singlet fraction arbitrarily close to unity can be obtained with nonzero probability. We show that a slight modification of the state has a threshold for singlet fraction which cannot be exceeded anymore.},

Several examples are given to illustrate the build up to a complete calculation. Finally, we measure the performance of our library against that of current implementations.

These protocols, originally devised only to correct for static, systematic errors, are shown to be robust to time-dependent non-Markovian noise in the control field up to frequencies as high as \textasciitilde 10\% of the Rabi frequency. Our study combines a generalized filter-function approach with asymptotic dc-limit calculations to give a simple analytic framework for error analysis applied to a number of composite-pulse sequences relevant to nuclear magnetic resonance as well as quantum information experiments. Results include examination of recently introduced concatenated composite pulses and dynamically corrected gates, demonstrating equivalent first-order suppression of time-dependent fluctuations in amplitude and/or detuning, as appropriate for the sequence in question. Our analytic results agree well with numerical simulations for realistic \$1/f\$ noise spectra with a roll-off to \$1/f\textasciicircum 2\$, providing independent validation of our theoretical insights.},

  abstract = {A key requirement for scalable quantum computing is that elementary quantum gates can be implemented with sufficiently low error. One method for determining the error behavior of a gate implementation is to perform process tomography. However, standard process tomography is limited by errors in state preparation, measurement and one-qubit gates. It suffers from inefficient scaling with number of qubits and does not detect adverse error-compounding when gates are composed in long sequences. An additional problem is due to the fact that desirable error probabilities for scalable quantum computing are of the order of 0.0001 or lower. Experimentally proving such low errors is challenging. We describe a randomized benchmarking method that yields estimates of the computationally relevant errors without relying on accurate state preparation and measurement. Since it involves long sequences of randomly chosen gates, it also verifies that error behavior is stable when used in long computations. We implemented randomized benchmarking on trapped atomic ion qubits, establishing a one-qubit error probability per randomized pi/2 pulse of 0.00482(17) in a particular experiment. We expect this error probability to be readily improved with straightforward technical modifications.},

  abstract = {Short dephasing times pose one of the main challenges in realizing a quantum computer. Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called "sweet spots." This latter approach led to significant improvement of \$T\_2\$ times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et al., Science 296, 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the "transmon." Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy \$E\_J/E\_C\$. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with \$E\_J/E\_C\$, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other known channels.},

  abstract = {Autocorrelated noise appears in many solid-state qubit systems and hence needs to be taken into account when developing gate operations for quantum information processing. However, explicitly simulating this kind of noise is often less efficient than approximate methods. Here, we focus on the filter function formalism, which allows the computation of gate fidelities in the presence of autocorrelated classical noise. Hence, this formalism can be combined with optimal control algorithms to design control pulses, which optimally implement quantum gates. To enable the use of gradient-based algorithms with fast convergence, we present analytically derived filter function gradients with respect to control pulse amplitudes, and analyze the computational complexity of our results. When comparing pulse optimization using our derivatives to a gradient-free approach, we find that the gradient-based method is roughly 2 orders of magnitude faster for our test cases. We also provide a modular computational implementation compatible with quantum optimal control packages.},

  abstract = {Electron spins in gate-defined quantum dots provide a promising platform for quantum computation. In particular, spin-based quantum computing in gallium arsenide takes advantage of the high quality of semiconducting materials, reliability in fabricating arrays of quantum dots, and accurate qubit operations. However, the effective magnetic noise arising from the hyperfine interaction with uncontrolled nuclear spins in the host lattice constitutes a major source of decoherence. Low frequency nuclear noise, responsible for fast (10 ns) inhomogeneous dephasing, can be removed by echo techniques. High frequency nuclear noise, recently studied via echo revivals, occurs in narrow frequency bands related to differences in Larmor precession of the three isotopes \$\textbackslash backslashmathbf\{\textasciicircum\{69\}Ga\}\$, \$\textbackslash backslashmathbf\{\textasciicircum\{71\}Ga\}\$, and \$\textbackslash backslashmathbf\{\textasciicircum\{75\}As\}\$. Here we show that both low and high frequency nuclear noise can be filtered by appropriate dynamical decoupling sequences, resulting in a substantial enhancement of spin qubit coherence times. Using nuclear notch filtering, we demonstrate a spin coherence time (\$\textbackslash backslashmathbf\{T\_\{2\}\}\$) of 0.87 ms, five orders of magnitude longer than typical exchange gate times, and exceeding the longest coherence times reported to date in Si/SiGe gate-defined quantum dots.},

  abstract = {Progress in fabrication of semiconductor and superconductor qubits has greatly diminished the number of decohering defects, thus decreasing the devastating low-frequency 1/𝑓 noise and extending the qubits' coherence times (dephasing time 𝑇*2 and the echo decay time 𝑇2). However, large qubit-to-qubit variation of the coherence properties remains a problem, making it difficult to produce a large-scale register where all qubits have a uniformly high quality. In this work, we show that large variability is a characteristic feature of a qubit dephased by a sparse bath made of many (𝑛≫1) decohering defects, coupled to the qubit with similar strength. We model the defects as two-level fluctuators (TLFs) whose transition rates 𝛾 are sampled from a log-uniform distribution over an interval [𝛾𝑚,𝛾𝑀], which is a standard model for 1/𝑓 noise. We investigate decoherence by such a bath in the limit of high-quality qubit, i.e., when the TLF density 𝑑 is small (the limit of sparse bath, with 𝑑=𝑛/𝑤≪1, where 𝑛 is the number of TLFs and 𝑤=ln⁡[𝛾𝑀/𝛾𝑚] is the log-width of the distribution). We show that different realizations of the bath produce very similar noise power spectra 𝑆⁡(𝑓)∼1/𝑓, but lead to drastically different coherence times 𝑇*2 and 𝑇2. Thus the spectral density 𝑆⁡(𝑓) does not determine coherence of a qubit coupled to a sparse TLF bath, as opposed to a dense bath; instead, decoherence is controlled by only a few exceptional fluctuators, determined by their value of 𝛾. We show that removing only two of these TLFs greatly increases 𝑇2 and 𝑇*2 times. Our findings help theoretical understanding and further improvements in the coherence properties of semiconductor and superconductor qubits, battling the 1/𝑓 noise in these platforms.},

  abstract = {Laboratory hardware is rapidly progressing towards a state where quantum error-correcting codes can be realised. As such, we must learn how to deal with the complex nature of the noise that may occur in real physical systems. Single qubit Pauli errors are commonly used to study the behaviour of error-correcting codes, but in general we might expect the environment to introduce correlated errors to a system. Given some knowledge of structures that errors commonly take, it may be possible to adapt the error-correction procedure to compensate for this noise, but performing full state tomography on a physical system to analyse this structure quickly becomes impossible as the size increases beyond a few qubits. Here we develop and test new methods to analyse blue a particular class of spatially correlated errors by making use of parametrised families of decoding algorithms. We demonstrate our method numerically using a diffusive noise model. We show that information can be learnt about the parameters of the noise model, and additionally that the logical error rates can be improved. We conclude by discussing how our method could be utilised in a practical setting blue and propose extensions of our work to study more general error models.},

  abstract = {We present a general transfer-function approach to noise filtering in open-loop Hamiltonian engineering protocols for open quantum systems. We show how to identify a computationally tractable set of fundamental filter functions, out of which arbitrary transfer filter functions may be assembled up to arbitrary high order in principle. Besides avoiding the infinite recursive hierarchy of filter functions that arises in general control scenarios, this fundamental filter-function set suffices to characterize the error suppression capabilities of the control protocol in both the time and the frequency domain. We prove that the resulting notion of filtering order reveals conceptually distinct, albeit complementary, features of the controlled dynamics as compared to the order of error cancellation, traditionally defined in the Magnus sense. Examples and implications are discussed. Hamiltonian engineering via open-loop quantum control provides a versatile and experimentally validated framework for manipulating the dynamics of a broad class of open quantum systems [1]. Applications range from dynamical decoupling (DD), composite pulse sequences, and dynamically corrected gates (DCGs) to noise spectroscopy and quantum simulation-see, e.g., Refs. [2-8] for recent contributions. In this context, generalized transfer filter function (FF) techniques motivated by control engineering are providing an increasingly important tool for understanding the dynamical response of the target system in Fourier space and for quantitatively analyzing the control performance [9-12]. In particular, this formalism has proved remarkably successful in predicting operational fidelities for a variety of control settings in recent trapped-ion experiments [13], as long as noise is sufficiently weak for low-order approximations to be viable. From a control-theory standpoint, a filtering approach to dynamical error suppression is desirable for a variety of reasons. Besides providing an open-loop counterpart to the transfer-function perspective that is central to both classical and quantum feedback networks [14], FF techniques allow, when available, for a substantially more efficient analysis of the underlying noisy dynamics than direct simulation [15,16]. Furthermore, unlike traditional time-dependent per-turbative approaches (such as the Magnus expansion [1,17]), a frequency-space picture may open up new possibilities for tailoring control synthesis and optimization to specific spectral features of the noise. The existing FF framework suffers, however, from severe limitations. Even if formal expressions for gate fidelity may be given based on an infinite recursive hierarchy of generalized FFs [12], higher-order FFs become rapidly intractable. Thus, explicit calculations have largely focused thus far on single-qubit controlled dynamics in the presence of classical noise, by truncating this recursion to the lowest order and additionally exploiting Gaussian noise statistics. As experiments are revealing the importance of higher-order terms outside the weak-noise regime [13] and are rapidly progressing toward coupled-qubit systems or more complex, non-Gaussian error models or both [18], overcoming these limitations becomes imperative for further progress. An additional shortcoming arises from the fact that only in very special situations where a single FF suffices to characterize the controlled dynamics may one unambigu-ously identify the "order of error suppression" of the protocol, associated with the order of cancellation in the Magnus expansion, with its "filtering order," determined by the low-frequency behavior of the FF [4,12]. Thus, the present theory does not lend itself to the identification of relevant filtering notions for general control scenarios. In this Letter, we show how a filtering framework for open-loop dynamical control may be built based on an easily computable set of fundamental filter functions (FFFs). This is achieved by recasting the filtering problem in a form that makes it clear how, despite the unwieldy recursive construction through which generalized FFs are defined, they all share a common structure. FFFs leverage this structure to enable for arbitrary high-order generalized FFs to be expressed as simple linear combinations of products of elements in the set. The identification of this FFF set is the main contribution of this Letter. We show that FFFs encode all the relevant information about the error-suppressing capabilities of a control protocol in both the time and the frequency domain. In addition, they suffice to rigorously characterize the (minimum) order of cancellation vs filtering that can be guaranteed when no specific assumptions are made on the noise model-other than the bath operators be norm bounded, in the same spirit as DCG theory [6] and non-Markovian quantum error correction [19]. We prove that cancellation and filtering are inequi-valent notions, with high-order cancellation in the Magnus sense not implying high-order filtering in general, and with both notions being},

Our protocols are capable of reconstructing all the noise auto-and cross-correlation spectra entering the multiqubit dynamics, providing access, in particular, to the asymmetric spectra associated with nonclassical environments. Our result relies on (i) an exact analytic solution for the reduced multiqubit dynamics that holds in the presence of an arbitrary Gaussian environment and dephasing-preserving control; (ii) the use of specific timing symmetries, which allow for a frequency comb to be engineered for all filter functions of interest, and for the spectra to be related to experimentally accessible observables. We show that quantum spectra have distinctive dynamical signatures, which we explore in two paradigmatic open-system models describing spin and charge qubits coupled to bosonic environments. Complete noise spectroscopy is demonstrated numerically in a realistic setting consisting of two-exciton qubits coupled to a phonon bath. The estimated spectra allow us to accurately predict the exciton dynamics as well as extract the temperature and spectral density of the quantum environment.},

Atoms have been successfully used to store and process quantum information in electromagnetic traps, as well as in diamond through the use of the nitrogen-vacancy-centre point defect. Solid-state electrical devices possess great potential to scale up such demonstrations from few-qubit control to larger-scale quantum processors. Coherent control of spin qubits has been achieved in lithographically defined double quantum dots in both GaAs (refs 3-5) and Si (ref. 6). However, it is a formidable challenge to combine the electrical measurement capabilities of engineered nanostructures with the benefits inherent in atomic spin qubits. Here we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin qubit bound to a phosphorus donor atom in natural silicon, measured electrically via single-shot read-out. We use electron spin resonance to drive Rabi oscillations, and a Hahn echo pulse sequence reveals a spin coherence time exceeding 200μs. This time should be even longer in isotopically enriched 28 Si samples. Combined with a device architecture that is compatible with modern integrated circuit technology, the electron spin of a single phosphorus atom in silicon should be an excellent platform on which to build a scalable quantum computer. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

One example where the Rayleigh distribution naturally arises is when wind velocity is analyzed in two dimensions. Assuming that each component is uncorrelated, normally distributed with equal variance, and zero mean, which is infrequent, then the overall wind speed (vector magnitude) will be characterized by a Rayleigh distribution.    A second example of the distribution arises in the case of random complex numbers whose real and imaginary components are independently and identically distributed Gaussian with equal variance and zero mean.

Relating these minimal times to the number of qubits gives the tightest known upper bounds to the actual time complexity of the quantum modules. As will be shown, time complexity is a more realistic measure of the experimental cost than the usual gate complexity. In the limit of fast local controls (as, e.g., in NMR), time-optimized realizations are shown for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and the multiply controlled NOT gate (Cn-1NOT) in various coupling topologies of n qubits. The speed-ups are substantial: in a chain of six qubits the quantum Fourier transform so far obtained by optimal control is more than eight times faster than the standard decomposition into controlled phase, Hadamard and SWAP gates, while the Cn-1NOT gate for a completely coupled network of six qubits is nearly seven times faster. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

  abstract = {Instabilities due to extrinsic interference are routinely faced in systems engineering, and a common solution is to rely on a broad class of \$\textbackslash textit\{filtering\}\$ techniques in order to afford stability to intrinsically unstable systems. For instance, electronic systems are frequently designed to incorporate electrical filters composed of, \$\textbackslash textit\{e.g.\}\$ RLC components, in order to suppress the effects of out-of-band fluctuations that interfere with desired performance. Quantum coherent systems are now moving to a level of complexity where challenges associated with realistic time-dependent noise are coming to the fore. Unfortunately, standard control solutions involving feedback are generally impossible due to the strictures of quantum mechanics, and existing error-suppressing gate constructions generally rely on unphysical bang-bang controls or quasi-static error models that do not reflect realistic laboratory environments. In this work we use the theory of quantum control engineering and experiments with trapped \$\textasciicircum\{171\}\$Yb\$\textasciicircum\{+\}\$ ions to demonstrate the construction of novel \$\textbackslash textit\{noise filters\}\$ which are specifically designed to mitigate the effect of realistic time-dependent fluctuations on qubits \textbackslash emph\{during useful operations\}. Starting with desired filter characteristics and the Walsh basis functions, we use a combination of analytic design rules and numeric search to construct time-domain noise filters tailored to a desired state transformation. Our results validate the generalized filter-transfer function framework for arbitrary quantum control operations, and demonstrate that it can be leveraged as an effective and efficient tool for developing novel robust control protocols.},

We introduce qopt, a software framework for simulating qubit dynamics and robust quantum optimal control considering common experimental situations. To this end, we model open and closed qubit systems with a focus on the simulation of realistic noise characteristics and experimental constraints. Specifically, the influence of noise can be calculated using Monte Carlo methods, effective master equations or with the efficient filter function formalism, which enables the investigation and mitigation of autocorrelated noise. In addition, limitations of control electronics, including finite bandwidth effects as well as nonlinear transfer functions and drive-dependent noise, can be considered. The calculation of gradients based on analytic results is implemented to facilitate the efficient optimization of control pulses. The software easily interfaces with QuTiP, is published under an open-source license, is well tested, and features a detailed documentation.},

By enforcing a simple analytical condition, we obtain sets of dynamical decoupling sequences that are designed for optimized noise filtration and are spectrum-independent up to a single scaling factor set by the coherence time of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of these sequences in suppressing phase errors through measurements on a model qubit system, \$\textasciicircum\{9\}\$Be\$\textasciicircum\{+\}\$ ions in a Penning trap. Our combined theoretical and experimental studies show that in high-frequency-dominated noise environments this approach may suppress phase errors orders of magnitude more efficiently than comparable techniques can.},

  abstract = {Quantum processors rely on classical electronic controllers to manipulate and read out the quantum state. As the performance of the quantum processor improves, non-idealities in the classical controller can become the performance bottleneck for the whole quantum computer. To prevent such limitation, this paper presents a systematic study of the impact of the classical electrical signals on the qubit fidelity. All operations, i.e. single-qubit rotations, two-qubit gates and read-out, are considered, in the presence of errors in the control electronics, such as static, dynamic, systematic and random errors. Although the presented study could be extended to any qubit technology, it currently focuses on single-electron spin qubits, because of several advantages, such as purely electrical control and long coherence times, and for their potential for large-scale integration. As a result of this study, detailed electrical specifications for the classical control electronics for a given qubit fidelity can be derived, as demonstrated with specific case studies. We also discuss the effect on qubit fidelity of the performance of the general-purpose room-temperature equipment that is typically employed to control the few qubits available today. Ultimately, we show that tailor-made electronic controllers can achieve significantly lower power, cost and size, as required to support the scaling up of quantum computers.},

We discuss how to choose experimental parameters, in particular the number and lengths of random sequences, in order to characterize average gate errors with rigorous confidence bounds. We also show that randomized benchmarking can be used to reliably characterize time-dependent Markovian noise (e.g., when noise is due to a magnetic field with fluctuating strength).

Here we perform an experiment in which a superconducting two-level system, playing the role of an artificial atom, is coupled to an on-chip cavity consisting of a superconducting transmission line resonator. We show that the strong coupling regime can be attained in a solid-state system, and we experimentally observe the coherent interaction of a superconducting two-level system with a single microwave photon. The concept of circuit quantum electrodynamics opens many new possibilities for studying the strong interaction of light and matter. This system can also be exploited for quantum information processing and quantum communication and may lead to new approaches for single photon generation and detection.},

  urldate = {2025-03-27},
  abstract = {In signal processing and statistics, a window function (also known as an apodization function or tapering function) is a mathematical function that is zero-valued outside of some chosen interval. Typically, window functions are symmetric around the middle of the interval, approach a maximum in the middle, and taper away from the middle. Mathematically, when another function or waveform/data-sequence is "multiplied" by a window function, the product is also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they overlap, the "view through the window".  Equivalently, and in actual practice, the segment of data within the window is first isolated, and then only that data is multiplied by the window function values.  Thus, tapering, not segmentation, is the main purpose of window functions. The reasons for examining segments of a longer function include detection of transient events and time-averaging of frequency spectra.  The duration of the segments is determined in each application by requirements like time and frequency resolution.  But that method also changes the frequency content of the signal by an effect called spectral leakage.  Window functions allow us to distribute the leakage spectrally in different ways, according to the needs of the particular application.  There are many choices detailed in this article, but many of the differences are so subtle as to be insignificant in practice. In typical applications, the window functions used are non-negative, smooth, "bell-shaped" curves. Rectangle, triangle, and other functions can also be used.  A more general definition of window functions does not require them to be identically zero outside an interval, as long as the product of the window multiplied by its argument is square integrable, and, more specifically, that the function goes sufficiently rapidly toward zero.},

  abstract = {Gate operations in a quantum information processor are generally realized by tailoring specific periods of free and driven evolution of a quantum system. Unwanted environmental noise, which may in principle be distinct during these two periods, acts to decohere the system and increase the gate error rate. While there has been significant progress characterizing noise processes during free evolution, the corresponding driven-evolution case is more challenging as the noise being probed is also extant during the characterization protocol. Here we demonstrate the noise spectroscopy (0.1 - 200 MHz) of a superconducting flux qubit during driven evolution by using a robust spin-locking pulse sequence to measure relaxation (T1rho) in the rotating frame. In the case of flux noise, we resolve spectral features due to coherent fluctuators, and further identify a signature of the 1MHz defect in a time-domain spin-echo experiment. The driven-evolution noise spectroscopy complements free-evolution methods, enabling the means to characterize and distinguish various noise processes relevant for universal quantum control.},

  abstract = {Single-qubit rotations and two-qubit CNOT operations are crucial ingredients for universal quantum computing. Although high-fidelity single-qubit operations have been achieved using the electron spin degree of freedom, realizing a robust CNOT gate has been challenging because of rapid nuclear spin dephasing and charge noise. We demonstrate an efficient resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins in silicon. Our platform achieves single-qubit rotations with fidelities greater than 99\%, as verified by randomized benchmarking. Gate control of the exchange coupling allows a quantum CNOT gate to be implemented with resonant driving in \textasciitilde 200 nanoseconds. We used the CNOT gate to generate a Bell state with 78\% fidelity (corrected for errors in state preparation and measurement). Our quantum dot device architecture enables multi-qubit algorithms in silicon.},

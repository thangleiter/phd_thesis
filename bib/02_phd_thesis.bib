  abstract = {The filter function formalism quantitatively describes the dephasing of a qubit by a bath that causes Gaussian fluctuations in the qubit energies with an arbitrary noise power spectrum. Here, we extend this formalism to account for more general types of noise that couple to the qubit through terms that do not commute with the qubit's bare Hamiltonian. Our approach applies to any power spectrum that generates slow noise fluctuations in the qubit's evolution. We demonstrate our formalism in the case of singlet-triplet qubits subject to both quasistatic nuclear noise and \$1/\textbackslash omega\textasciicircum\textbackslash alpha\$ charge noise and find good agreement with recent experimental findings. This comparison shows the efficacy of our approach in describing real systems and additionally highlights the challenges with distinguishing different types of noise in free induction decay experiments.},

  abstract = {IN his review1 of M. G. Kendall‘s brochure2 on oscillatory time-series, David G. Kendall made the pertinent observation that the smoothing of periodograms obtained from autoregressive or other time-series with continuous spectra is equivalent to considering the first few sample autocorrelations. I had arrived at a similar conclusion, though possibly by an alternative route, having noticed that the averaging of periodograms obtained from contiguous lengths of series is approximately equivalent to a truncation of the correlogram at a point represented by the length of the subseries. From preliminary computation already made on M. G. Kendall‘s artificial series to test out this smoothing device, it appears promising.},

Recent experiments have demonstrated multi-qubit quantum processors, optical interconnects, and basic quantum error correction protocols. One of the key open challenges towards larger-scale systems is to realize high-fidelity universal quantum gates. In this work, we design and demonstrate a complete high-fidelity gate set for the two-qubit system formed by the electron and nuclear spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We use gate set tomography (GST) to systematically optimise the gates and demonstrate single-qubit gate fidelities of up to \$99.999(1)\textbackslash\%\$ and a two-qubit gate fidelity of \$99.93(5) \textbackslash\%\$. Our gates are designed to decouple unwanted interactions and can be extended to other electron-nuclear spin systems. The high fidelities demonstrated provide new opportunities towards larger-scale quantum processing with colour-center qubits.},

  abstract = {Many qubit implementations are afflicted by correlated noise not captured by standard theoretical tools that are based on Markov approximations. While independent gate operations are a key concept for quantum computing, it is actually not possible to fully describe noisy gates locally in time if noise is correlated on times longer than their duration. To address this issue, we develop a method based on the filter function formalism to perturbatively compute quantum processes in the presence of correlated classical noise. We derive a composition rule for the filter function of a sequence of gates in terms of those of the individual gates. The joint filter function allows to efficiently compute the quantum process of the whole sequence. Moreover, we show that correlation terms arise which capture the effects of the concatenation and thus yield insight into the effect of noise correlations on gate sequences. Our generalization of the filter function formalism enables both qualitative and quantitative studies of algorithms and state-of-the-art tools widely used for the experimental verification of gate fidelities like randomized benchmarking, even in the presence of noise correlations.},

  abstract = {Cryogenic confocal microscopy is a powerful method for studying solid state quantum devices such as single photon sources and optically controlled qubits. While the vast majority of such studies have been conducted at temperatures of a few Kelvin, experiments involving fragile quantum effects often require lower operating temperatures. To also allow for electrical dynamic control, microwave connectivity is required. For polarization-sensitive studies, free space optical access is advantageous compared to fiber coupling. Here we present a confocal microscope in a dilution refrigerator providing all the above features at temperatures below 100 mK. The installed high frequency cabling meets the requirements for state-of-the-art spin qubit experiments. As another unique advantage of our system, the sample fitting inside a large puck can be exchanged while keeping the cryostat cold with minimal realignment. Assessing the performance of the instrument, we demonstrate confocal imaging, sub-nanosecond modulation of the emission wavelength of a suitable sample, and an electron temperature of 76 mK. While the instrument was constructed primarily with the development of optical interfaces to electrically controlled qubits in mind, it can be used for many experiments involving quantum transport, solid state quantum optics, and microwave-optical transducers.},

  abstract = {Interfacing stationary matter qubits with flying photonic qubits is of major interest in quantum computing and quantum communication technology as it is a necessary requirement to create a distributed quantum computer or a quantum network. Assuming a spin-based stationary qubit, Gallium-Arsenide (GaAs) spin qubit in gate-defined quantum dots (GDQD) would be a promising candidate for a spin-photon interface as the direct bandgap of GaAs allows interaction with light. However, as the confinement in GDQD results from electrostatic potentials, either holes or electrons can be confined but not jointly. Since the spin of the photo-electron is entangled with the spin of the photo-hole after photon absorption, the loss of the latter would lead to decoherence of the former. To provide a coherent transfer of information between the spin qubit and the photonic qubit, one solution is to modify the conventional heterostructure and gate architecture to embed an exciton trap as an intermediary. In this thesis, we implement the exciton trap by including a quantum well (QW) in the heterostructure and by patterning two local metal gates vertically aligned on both sides of the heterostructure. The QW provides the confinement along the growth direction while an electric field applied between the opposite metal gates confines the exciton in-plane by the quantum-confined Stark effect. Patterning these gates on the two sides of the 220 nm heterostructure involves a demanding fabrication process as the substrate has to be removed. To characterize the devices, a dilution refrigerator was customized to enable spin qubit and photoluminescence measurements at millikelvin temperatures. As a first approach to accumulate the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the QW needed to form GDQD, double-side doping of the barriers was considered. Hall measurements showed that a high mobility electron gas (above 106 cm2/(Vs)) can still be obtained on a thinned heterostructure. Quantum point contacts and single GDQD can also be formed. The thin doped heterostructure showed the photoluminescence expected from a QW filled with electrons populating the lowest sub-band of the 2DEG. The formation of an exciton trap by the quantum-confined Stark effect with top and bottom local gates is also possible provided depletion of the 2DEG underneath the trapping gates. Although the doped heterostructure demonstrated the basic prerequisites to create the aforementioned spin-photon interface, the undesired optical excitations of the DX centers added to the poor material quality pushed for the development of a second approach based on dopant-free heterostructures. On undoped heterostructure, the photoluminescence properties of exciton traps with a global grown back-gate were first investigated to reproduce already-known behaviors.},

For example, interfacing stationary solid-state qubits with photonic quantum states would open up a pathway towards the realization of a quantum network with extended quantum processing capacity in each node. While gated devices allow very flexible confinement of electrons or holes, the confinement of excitons without some element of self-assembly is much harder. To address this limitation, we introduce a technique to realize exciton traps in quantum wells via local electric fields by thinning a heterostructure down to a 220-nm-thick membrane. We show that mobilities over 1×106cm2V−1s−1 can be retained and that quantum point contacts and Coulomb oscillations can be observed on this structure, which implies that the thinning does not compromise the heterostructure quality. Furthermore, the local lowering of the exciton energy via the quantum-confined Stark effect is confirmed, thus forming exciton traps. These results lay the technological foundations for devices like single-photon sources, spin-photon interfaces and eventually quantum network nodes in GaAs quantum wells, realized entirely with a top-down fabrication process.},

  abstract = {Progress in fabrication of semiconductor and superconductor qubits has greatly diminished the number of decohering defects, thus decreasing the devastating low-frequency 1/𝑓 noise and extending the qubits' coherence times (dephasing time 𝑇*2 and the echo decay time 𝑇2). However, large qubit-to-qubit variation of the coherence properties remains a problem, making it difficult to produce a large-scale register where all qubits have a uniformly high quality. In this work, we show that large variability is a characteristic feature of a qubit dephased by a sparse bath made of many (𝑛≫1) decohering defects, coupled to the qubit with similar strength. We model the defects as two-level fluctuators (TLFs) whose transition rates 𝛾 are sampled from a log-uniform distribution over an interval [𝛾𝑚,𝛾𝑀], which is a standard model for 1/𝑓 noise. We investigate decoherence by such a bath in the limit of high-quality qubit, i.e., when the TLF density 𝑑 is small (the limit of sparse bath, with 𝑑=𝑛/𝑤≪1, where 𝑛 is the number of TLFs and 𝑤=ln⁡[𝛾𝑀/𝛾𝑚] is the log-width of the distribution). We show that different realizations of the bath produce very similar noise power spectra 𝑆⁡(𝑓)∼1/𝑓, but lead to drastically different coherence times 𝑇*2 and 𝑇2. Thus the spectral density 𝑆⁡(𝑓) does not determine coherence of a qubit coupled to a sparse TLF bath, as opposed to a dense bath; instead, decoherence is controlled by only a few exceptional fluctuators, determined by their value of 𝛾. We show that removing only two of these TLFs greatly increases 𝑇2 and 𝑇*2 times. Our findings help theoretical understanding and further improvements in the coherence properties of semiconductor and superconductor qubits, battling the 1/𝑓 noise in these platforms.},

The basic idea is to engineer a multi-dimensional frequency comb via repetition of suitably designed pulse sequences, through which the desired high-order noise spectra may be related to observable properties of the qubit probe. We prove that access to a high time resolution is key to achieve spectral reconstruction over an extended bandwidth, overcoming limitations of existing schemes. Non-Gaussian spectroscopy is demonstrated for a classical noise model describing quadratic dephasing at an optimal point, as well as a quantum spin-boson model out of equilibrium. In both cases, we obtain spectral reconstructions that accurately predict the qubit dynamics in the non-Gaussian regime.},

Our protocols are capable of reconstructing all the noise auto-and cross-correlation spectra entering the multiqubit dynamics, providing access, in particular, to the asymmetric spectra associated with nonclassical environments. Our result relies on (i) an exact analytic solution for the reduced multiqubit dynamics that holds in the presence of an arbitrary Gaussian environment and dephasing-preserving control; (ii) the use of specific timing symmetries, which allow for a frequency comb to be engineered for all filter functions of interest, and for the spectra to be related to experimentally accessible observables. We show that quantum spectra have distinctive dynamical signatures, which we explore in two paradigmatic open-system models describing spin and charge qubits coupled to bosonic environments. Complete noise spectroscopy is demonstrated numerically in a realistic setting consisting of two-exciton qubits coupled to a phonon bath. The estimated spectra allow us to accurately predict the exciton dynamics as well as extract the temperature and spectral density of the quantum environment.},

Up to rescaling, it coincides with the chi distribution with two degrees of freedom. The distribution is named after Lord Rayleigh (). A Rayleigh distribution is often observed when the overall magnitude of a vector in the plane is related to its directional components. One example where the Rayleigh distribution naturally arises is when wind velocity is analyzed in two dimensions. Assuming that each component is uncorrelated, normally distributed with equal variance, and zero mean, which is infrequent, then the overall wind speed (vector magnitude) will be characterized by a Rayleigh distribution.    A second example of the distribution arises in the case of random complex numbers whose real and imaginary components are independently and identically distributed Gaussian with equal variance and zero mean. In that case, the absolute value of the complex number is Rayleigh-distributed.},

  urldate = {2025-03-27},
  abstract = {In signal processing and statistics, a window function (also known as an apodization function or tapering function) is a mathematical function that is zero-valued outside of some chosen interval. Typically, window functions are symmetric around the middle of the interval, approach a maximum in the middle, and taper away from the middle. Mathematically, when another function or waveform/data-sequence is "multiplied" by a window function, the product is also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they overlap, the "view through the window".  Equivalently, and in actual practice, the segment of data within the window is first isolated, and then only that data is multiplied by the window function values.  Thus, tapering, not segmentation, is the main purpose of window functions. The reasons for examining segments of a longer function include detection of transient events and time-averaging of frequency spectra.  The duration of the segments is determined in each application by requirements like time and frequency resolution.  But that method also changes the frequency content of the signal by an effect called spectral leakage.  Window functions allow us to distribute the leakage spectrally in different ways, according to the needs of the particular application.  There are many choices detailed in this article, but many of the differences are so subtle as to be insignificant in practice. In typical applications, the window functions used are non-negative, smooth, "bell-shaped" curves. Rectangle, triangle, and other functions can also be used.  A more general definition of window functions does not require them to be identically zero outside an interval, as long as the product of the window multiplied by its argument is square integrable, and, more specifically, that the function goes sufficiently rapidly toward zero.},

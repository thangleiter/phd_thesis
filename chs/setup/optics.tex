\chapter{Characterization and improvements of the optical path}\label{ch:setup:optics}
\AutoLettrine{The} confocal microscope integrated into a millikelvin-temperature cryogen-free \gls{dr} accommodating free-space optical measurements together with DC and AC electrical control was designed and set up by \citeauthor{Descamps2024}~\cite{Descamps2021,Descamps2024}.
In this chapter, I lay out improvements to the design to improve the optical efficiency of the microscope.
I review the relevant relationships between optical parameters, estimate the maximum expected efficiency, and compare it to measurements.
Furthermore, I characterize the cross-polarization extinction and outline various schemes I established to automatically control the motorized stages regulating the excitation power and rejection as well as the diffraction grating spectrometer and \gls{ccd}.
Lastly, I demonstrate the setup's efficacy to measure photon anti-bunching in a \g2 measurement on self-assembled quantum dots in \ch{InGaAs}.

\section{Light coupling}\label{sec:setup:optics:coupling}
While the microscope arrangement on top of and inside the cryostat is free space optics to enable imaging of the sample, illumination and collected light are routed to and from the optical table using \glspl{smf}.
Convenience aside, for the illumination this is a natural choice since the guiding mode of these fibers very closely approximates the fundamental \TEM{00} laser mode~\cite{Kowalevicz2006}.
For the collected light, it is less obvious that a \gls{smf} is the best choice.
Coupling light -- of any mode profile -- in and out of fibers invariably incurs losses.
Because of the small mode field diameters on the order of a few micrometers, aligning the optics for coupling is a sensitive task and subject to external disturbances such as vibrations (\cf \cref{ch:setup:vibrations}).
Moreover, even for perfect mode matching and alignment, there are reflection losses on the percent level.
In \cref{subsec:setup:optics:coupling:efficiency}, I discuss the coupling of collected light into the \gls{smf} in more detail.
Despite these loss mechanisms, the single-mode character of the detection fiber is crucial to the microscope's operation because the cross-polarization extinction critically relies on the spatial filtering of the reflected mode by the fiber~\cite{Benelajla2021,Steindl2023}.
I discuss the cross-polarization extinction in more detail in \cref{subsec:setup:optics:coupling:rejection}.

\subsection{Choosing lenses}\label{subsec:setup:optics:coupling:lenses}

\begin{marginfigure}

    \caption[\imgsource{img/tikz/setup/optical_path.tex}]{
        Reduced sketch of the microscope optical path.
        A Gaussian beam is launched from a \gls{smf} and collimated by the excitation ocular (E).

    \label{fig:setup:optics:optical_path}
\end{marginfigure}

\Cref{fig:setup:optics:optical_path} shows a sketch of the free space optical path.
There are three lenses that need to fulfil different tasks.
First, the excitation ocular (E), which collimates the Gaussian beam launched from the fiber.
Next, the objective lens (O), which focuses the beam onto the sample and at the same time collects and collimates the reflected and emitted light.
Finally, the collected light is focused by the detection ocular (D) into another fiber for spectral analysis.
Since Gaussian beams behave fundamentally differently to geometrical optics, there are different requirements for the lens specifications.
In the following, I will review the different beam behaviors and outline the rationale behind the choices made for the lenses.

The fundamental Gaussian \TEM{00} mode has the rotationally symmetric electric field profile~\cite{Yariv1989}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efield:tem00}
E(\rho, z) = E_0\frac{w_0}{w(z)}\exp\left\lbrace -\i\left[kz - \arctan(\frac{z}{z_0})\right] - \rho^2\left[\frac{1}{w(z)^2} + \frac{ik}{2 R(z)}\right]\right\rbrace
\end{equation}
with the beam waist radius $w_0$, the beam's $1/\e$-radius
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:gaussian:radius}
    w(z)^2 = w_0^2\left(1 + \frac{z^2}{z_0^2}\right),
\end{equation}
the wavefront radius of curvature
\begin{equation}
    R(z) = z\left(1 + \frac{z_0^2}{z^2}\right),
\end{equation}
the Rayleigh range
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:gaussian:rayleigh_range}
    z_0 = \frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda},
\end{equation}
and where $z=0$ at the beam waist as well as $\lambda = \lambda_0/n$ the wavelength in the propagating medium.
For a \gls{smf}, the \gls{mfd} is $2 w_0$ and a beam launched from it expands according to \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:gaussian:radius} with $z=0$ in its end face.

The Rayleigh range determines the the extent of the mode's near field.
At $z=z_0$, the diameter of the beam is $w(z_0) = w_0\sqrt{2}$.
In the far field, the beam divergence is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:gaussian:divergence}
    \theta_{\mr{beam}} = \arctan(\frac{w_0}{z_0}) \approx \frac{\lambda}{\pi w_0}.
\end{equation}
Collimating a Gaussian beam emerging from a \gls{smf} thus requires matching $\theta_{\mr{beam}}$ with the \gls{na} of the lens such that $\NA\geq\sin\theta_{\mr{beam}}$.
Conversely, coupling a beam into a \gls{smf} requires matching the fiber's \gls{mfd} to the spot size, which is constrained by diffraction.
From \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:gaussian:divergence} we find, by setting $w = f\tan\theta_{\mr{beam}}$, the rule-of-thumb
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:gaussian:diffraction_limit}
    w_0 \approx \frac{\lambda f}{\pi w}
\end{equation}
where $w$ is the beam radius at the focusing lens.\sidenote{
    Note that this disregards diffraction at the aperture and is thus only a good approximation for a \acrshort{ca} well larger than $w$.
}
For non-Gaussian beams one typically assumes a flattop profile whose diffraction pattern is given by~\cite{Hecht2017},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:flattop:diffraction_pattern}
    E(\rho) = E_0 2\pi w^2 \frac{\exp(-\i k f)}{f} \frac{J_1(\flatfrac{kw\rho}{f})}{\flatfrac{kw\rho}{f}},
\end{equation}
where $w$ is the radius of the lens aperture and $J_1(x)$ is the Bessel function of order one, and quotes the radius of the first Airy disk,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:flattop:diffraction_limit}
    w_0 \approx 1.22\frac{\lambda f}{2 w}.
\end{equation}
Finally, let us note that the efficiency with which two electric field modes $E_1$ and $E_2$ can be matched, the \emph{matching efficiency}, is given by the normalized spatial overlap integral~\cite{Paschotta2005},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efficiency:mode_matching}
    \eta_{\mr{m}}(E_1, E_2) = \frac{\int\dd{S}\abs{E_1(\rho)}^2\int\dd{S}\abs{E_2(\rho)}^2}{\abs{\int\dd{S} E_1(\rho) E_2(\rho)}^2}.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Excitation path}
Now, for as small a spot on the sample as possible, we conclude from \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:gaussian:diffraction_limit} that we should choose an objective lens with a small focal length \fob (large \acrshort{na}) and illuminate it with a beam with a large diameter $2 w$.
As the lens diameter and hence the \acrfull{ca}\sidenote{
    The \gls{ca} is the diameter over which the lens specifications hold.
    Outside this diameter, light may still be transmitted but is not guaranteed to behave according to the lens design.
}
is constrained by the available space in the sample puck, the best lens was found to be \objectivelens~\cite{Thorlabs354330} with $\fob = \qty{3.1}{\milli\meter}$, $\NA = \num{0.7}$, and infinity-side $\mr{\acrshort{ca}} = \qty{5}{\milli\meter}$.\sidenote{
    A lens with even higher \gls{na} exists~\cite{LightPath355330} but I found it to have too short a \gls{wd} to put our flip-chipped samples into focus.
    Samples with a different mounting strategy might benefit from the slightly increased focusing power of that lens.
}
Having chosen the objective lens, we can next select the excitation ocular to match the beam diameter.
For our typical excitation wavelengths around \qty{800}{\nano\meter}, the best-matching \gls{smf} has $\mr{\acrshort{mfd}} = 2 w_0 = \qty{5}{\micro\meter}$~\cite{Thorlabs780HP}.
Again using \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:gaussian:diffraction_limit} and solving for $f$, we find $\foc = \flatfrac{\pi w_0 w}{\lambda} \approx \qty{24.5}{\milli\meter}$ when setting $w = \flatfrac{\mr{\acrshort{ca}}}{2}$.
Since $w$ specifies the $\flatfrac{1}{e}$-radius of the beam, we should choose a lens resulting in a collimated beam diameter that is smaller than the \gls{ca}, \ie, a shorter focal length.
The lens that best matches this requirement is \ocularlens~\cite{ThorlabsA280TM} with $\foc = \qty{18.4}{\milli\meter}$, resulting in a collimated beam diameter of $2 w \approx\qty{3.8}{\milli\meter}$.\sidenote{
    A lens with larger focal length and hence wider beam diameter and resulting smaller spot size exists~\cite{LightPath354850} but its design wavelength is further off from our typical working wavelengths.
    It is also unmounted, making its integration into the optical head more cumbersome.
}
Collimating the Gaussian beam launched from a \gls{smf} may be viewed as transforming the beam waist $w_0\to w$, implying that the Rayleigh range after collimation is $z_0\approx\qty{14}{\meter}$ (\cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:gaussian:rayleigh_range}), and the objective lens at a distance of $z\sim\qty{1.5}{\meter}$ is well in the beam's near field with negligible divergence (\cf \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:gaussian:radius}).
With the beam diameter and focal lengths set, we can compute the expected spot size to be $2 w_0\approx\qty{0.84}{\micro\meter}$.
In \cref{subsec:setup:optics:coupling:imaging} and \cref{sec:setup:vibrations:optic}, I compare this value to measurements.

We have thus far addressed illumination of the sample with Gaussian laser light.
What now remains to deal with is the reverse direction; that is, collection of the emitted photoluminescence and focusing it into a \gls{smf} using the detection ocular lens (\enquote{D} in \cref{fig:setup:optics:optical_path}).
Before turning our attention to that task, let us briefly compare the expected performance with the lenses chosen here to those chosen in \citer{Descamps2021}.
There, the ocular lens had a focal length of $\foc = \qty{6.2}{\milli\meter}$ and the objective lens $\fob = \qty{4.51}{\milli\meter}$.
With these parameters, we obtain a beam diameter of $2w \approx\qty{1.3}{\milli\meter}$ just after collimation and a Rayleigh range of $z_0\approx\qty{1.5}{\meter}$, implying that the beam broadens by $\sim\sqrt{2}$ by the time it arrives at the objective lens $z\sim\qty{1.5}{\meter}$ away.
This would result in a spot size of $2 w_0\approx\qty{1.3}{\micro\meter}$, roughly a factor of two larger than with the lenses we chose here.

\paragraph{Detection path}\label{par:setup:optics:coupling:detection}
To choose an appropriate lens for focusing light into the \gls{smf} for spectroscopic analysis, the detection ocular (\enquote{D} in \cref{fig:setup:optics:optical_path}), let us assume that the objective lens is fully illuminated by the emitted light.
This results in a beam with diameter corresponding to the infinity-side \gls{ca} of the objective lens.
Further neglecting beam divergence, we must then choose the focal length of the ocular such that the diffraction-limited spot size matches the \gls{mfd} of the \gls{smf}.
Taking the beam to have a flattop profile, an assumption that I test more closely in \cref{subsec:setup:optics:coupling:efficiency}, the radius of the first Airy disk is given by \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:flattop:diffraction_limit}.
For the objective lens chosen in the previous paragraph, inverting that equation leads to $f\approx\qty{12.8}{\milli\meter}$.
However, the first Airy disk includes slightly less of the total power than the $1/e^2$ diameter of a Gaussian beam (\cf \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efield:tem00}) corresponding to the \gls{smf}'s \gls{mfd}.
I therefore chose a slightly larger focal length, leading to the same lens as used for the excitation ocular, \ocularlens with $\foc = \qty{18.4}{\milli\meter}$ and resulting in a mode matching efficiency for a hypothetical flattop beam of $\eta_{\mr{m}} = \qty{78}{\percent}$.\sidenote{
    Numerical optimization of the mode overlap given by \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efficiency:mode_matching} for \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efield:tem00,eq:setup:optics:coupling:flattop:diffraction_pattern} results in $\foc=\qty{21.6}{\milli\meter}$ and $\eta_{\mr{m}}=\qty{82}{\percent}$, indicating the choice fits quite well.
}
Again comparing the lens chosen here with that by \citer{Descamps2021} with $\foc = \qty{6.2}{\milli\meter}$, we find that we expect only $\eta_{\mr{m}} = \qty{13}{\percent}$ of a flattop beam's intensity focused onto the fiber end face to couple into the fiber's \TEM{00} mode.

        For lenses with different \acrlongpl{ca} on both sides, I assume a magnification of the beam by their ratio, resulting in the deviation from the theoretical beam diameter shown as a dashed gray line for some lenses, but note that this is a rough approximation for lens underfulling in particular.

\end{figure*}

The above considerations for choosing lenses are visualized in \cref{fig:setup:optics:coupling:lenses}, which plots selected lenses from the Thorlabs and Edmund Optics catalog for different scenarios to help selecting models for a specific task.
The left panel deals with Gaussian optics and plots the collimated beam diameter $D$ of a Gaussian beam launched from the \gls{smf}, collimated by the given lens, and monitored at a distance of $z=\qty{1.5}{\meter}$ behind it.
This takes into account beam expansion due to diffraction, which depends on the focal length of the collimating lens and results in the non-monotonous dependence $D(f)$.
The contours indicate the expected spot size of the beam when the objective lens is illuminated by a beam of diameter $D$.
The right panel deals with geometric optics and plots the \gls{na} computed from the \gls{ca} diameter $D$ and the focal length as $\NA = \sin\arctan(D/2f)$.\sidenote{
    Note that for high \gls{na}, this value can deviate from the value quoted by the manufacturer.
}
To choose a pair of collimating and objective lenses, first pick the former from the left panel.
Then choose an objective lens from the right panel to suit the focusing power needs.
Identifying the objective lens in the left panel and drawing a vertical line from its focal length and a horizontal line from the collimator's beam diameter gives the expected spot size of the beam where the two lines cross.

Having picked the lenses defining the characteristics of the microscope, let us now take a closer look at the expected efficiency.

\subsection{Collection efficiency}\label{subsec:setup:optics:coupling:efficiency}
In a confocal microscope geometry, light is collected using the same lens that is also used for illumination of the sample.
For excitation with a Gaussian laser beam but non-Gaussian radiation being emitted, this means that two different beam behaviors need to be matched, a task that is likely not possible to achieve completely.
In the case of photoluminescence in a pristine semiconductor \gls{qw}, the optical interband transitions are well described by in-plane dipole matrix elements~\cite{Gu2013}.
If, on the other, the light emerges from a \gls{pcc}, the far field pattern is close to a Gaussian mode and the considerations below need to be adjusted accordingly~\cite{Wu2024}.
Here, I discuss dipole emission from the \gls{qw}, which needs to be coupled into a \gls{smf} with near-Gaussian mode profile, invariably resulting in losses.
A detailed analysis of the electric field profile to compute the expected coupling efficiency from the sample into the \gls{smf} is beyond our scope here as it would require taking into account the full sample and lens geometries as well as diffraction, a task only possible by employing a full-fledged numerical optics simulation suite.
However, we can make some crude simplifications of the problem to estimate the order of magnitude of these effects.
To this end, I model the light source as a point dipole beneath the surface of a homogeneous slab of dielectric material and the real lenses as ideal thin lenses.

    \label{fig:setup:optics:coupling:emission}
\end{marginfigure}

Consider the situation sketched in \cref{fig:setup:optics:coupling:emission}.
A dipole $\bvec{p}$ oriented along $x$ in the plane of a \ch{GaAs} \gls{qw} with refractive index $n$ buried at a depth $d$ beneath the surface of the sample emits light into the halfspace above it.
In spherical coordinates $(r, \vartheta, \varphi)$ oriented along $x$, that is, embedded in the cartesian coordinate system $(y, z, x)$, the emitted radiation has the field components~\cite{Griffiths2017}
\begin{align}
    \bvec{E}(r, \vartheta) &= A(r)\left[E_r(r, \vartheta)\ubvec{r} + E_{\vartheta}(r, \vartheta)\ubvec{\vartheta}\right] \label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:dipole:efield}\\
    \bvec{H}(r, \vartheta) &= \frac{\epsilon}{\mu} A(r) H_{\phi}(r, \vartheta)\ubvec{\phi} \label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:dipole:hfield}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
    A(r) &= \frac{\abs{\bvec{p}}k^2}{4\pi\epsilon}\frac{\exp(\i k r)}{r} \\
    E_r(r, \vartheta) &= \left(\frac{2}{k^2 r^2} - \frac{2\i}{k r}\right)\cos\vartheta \\
    E_{\vartheta}(r, \vartheta) &= \left(\frac{1}{k^2 r^2} - \frac{\i}{k r} - 1\right)\sin\vartheta \\
    H_{\phi}(r, \vartheta) &= -\left(\frac{\i}{k r} + 1\right)\sin\vartheta
\end{align}
and where $\vartheta=\arctan\left(\sqrt{z^2 + y^2}/x\right)$, $r$ is the distance from the point dipole, and $k=2\pi/\lambda=2\pi n/\lambda_0$ and $\epsilon=\epsilon_\mr{r}\epsilon_0$ are the wavenumber and the permittivity in the medium, respectively.
Since $kr$ is of order unity at $z=0$, the semiconductor surface is in the dipole's intermediate-field regime where all terms contribute roughly equally.

The emitted light is refracted at the surface and we collect and collimate it with an objective lens (labeled \enquote{O}) with $\NA=\sin\theta^\prime_\mr{m}$ at distance \fob above the surface of the sample, where \fob is the focal length and $\theta^\prime_\mr{m}$ the angle of the marginal ray.
The \gls{na} determines the maximum amount of light the objective lens can collect, and using Snell's law we can relate the angle of a ray outside the sample $\theta^\prime$ to the angle inside the sample $\theta = \arctan(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}/z)$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:snell}
    \sin\theta^\prime = n\sin\theta,
\end{equation}
with $n\approx 3.57$ at $\lambda_0=\qty{800}{\nano\meter}$ and $T=\qty{0}{\kelvin}$.
This yields $\theta_{\mr{m}} = \arcsin(\flatfrac{\mr{\acrshort{na}}}{n}) \approx\qty{11}{\degree}$ for the emission angle of the marginal ray inside the semiconductor, implying that only a small fraction of light escapes the sample.
Indeed, according to Poynting's theorem the radiated power through the surface $\Sigma$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:power}
    \expval{P} = \int_{\Sigma}\dd{\bvec{\Sigma}}\cdot\expval{\bvec{S}(r, \vartheta)}
\end{equation}
with the time-averaged Poynting vector
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:poynting}
    \expval{\bvec{S}(r, \vartheta)} = \frac{1}{2}\re(\bvec{E}(r, \vartheta)\times\bvec{H}^{\ast}(r, \vartheta)).
\end{equation}
As I show in \cref{sec:app:setup:optics:collection}, the fraction of the power radiated into the cone $\theta\in[0, \theta_{\mr{m}}]$ able to be collected by the objective lens, the \emph{collection efficiency}, is thus
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efficiency:collection}
    \eta_{\mr{c}} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{8 n^3}\left(4n^2 - \NA^2\right)\sqrt{n^2 - \NA^2} \approx \qty{1.4}{\percent}
\end{equation}
with $\NA=\num{0.7}$ for the chosen objective lens (\cf \cref{subsec:setup:optics:coupling:lenses}).

    \label{fig:setup:optics:coupling:modes_2d}
\end{marginfigure}

In order to estimate the fiber coupling efficiency of the light escaping the sample and collected by the objective lens focused by the ocular lens \enquote{D}, we need to consider refraction and transmission of the electric field at the surface, collimation by the objective lens, as well as diffraction at the ocular lens aperture.
A detailed accounting of these effects is beyond the scope of this thesis.
However, let us at least gain an intuition for the degree of these effects.
Since we observe the dipole, oriented in-plane inside the \gls{qw}, from the side, it is useful to rotate the spherical coordinate system so that it is embedded in the coordinate system $(x, y, z)$ as defined in \cref{fig:setup:optics:coupling:emission} with coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$.

The magnitude of the electric field vector in the surface plane, which I derive in more detail in \cref{sec:app:setup:optics:modes}, is shown in the upper panel of \cref{fig:setup:optics:coupling:modes_2d}.
The circle delimits the cone of emission bounded by $\theta_\mr{m}$ (radius $w_i$) while the arrows indicate the projection of the electric field $\bvec{E}(x, y, z)$ onto the interface, indicating that the polarization in the plane points mostly along $y$ at this distance from the source.
Accounting for refraction and modifying the perpendicular and parallel ($s$ and $p$) components of the electric field according to Fresnel's equations~\cite{Hecht2017} results in the electric field in the plane of the objective lens at a distance of $\fob$ shown in the lower panel.
Here, the circle indicates the \gls{ca} of the lens with radius $w_f$.
The picture is quite different from before.
First, the field is almost exclusively polarized along $x$, the dipole axis, as we might have expected.
Moreover, the intensity $\propto\abs{\bvec{E}}$ does not depend strongly on the azimuthal angle $\phi$ at this distance, allowing us to approximate the field as rotationally invariant to estimate the coupling efficiency into the \gls{smf}.\sidenote{
    Note that, while a fairly good approximation for the amplitude, this is likely not a good approximation for the phase because $k w_i \sim 1$, meaning that when the light exits the sample the phase is not constant across the surface, and the approximation as a point source just below the surface emitting a spherical wave warrants further investigation, \cf \cref{sec:app:setup:optics:modes}.
}
As shown in \cref{sec:app:setup:optics:modes}, the field after collimation is thus to good approximation given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efield:lens}
    \bvec{E}(r, \theta) = \tilde{A}(r)E_x(\theta)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align}
    \tilde{A}(r) &= \frac{\abs{\bvec{p}}k^2}{4\pi\epsilon}\frac{\exp(\i k z)}{r} \\
    E_x(\theta) &= \frac{2n\pi\cos\theta\left[\cos\theta + n\nu(\theta) + n\nu(\theta)\cos\theta + \nu(\theta)^2\right]}{[n\cos\theta + \nu(\theta)][\cos\theta + n\nu(\theta)]} \label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efield:lens:x}
\end{align}
and where $\nu(\theta) = \sqrt{1 - n^2\sin^2\theta}$.
For $\tilde{A}(r)$, we assumed a perfect lens that transforms a spherical wave front with constant phase at constant $r$ into a plane wave with constant phase at constant $z$.

The radial intensity profile ($\rho = \fob\tan\theta$ and $r=\sqrt{\rho^2 + \fob^2}$) given by the absolute value square of \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efield:lens} is shown in the upper panel of \cref{fig:setup:optics:coupling:modes_1d} together with a flattop (magenta) and a Gaussian (green) beam profile for comparison.
The intensity drops to about half its maximum at the edge of the lens aperture, $\rho=w$.
We may thus expect the mode matching to be qualitatively different from the flattop behavior discussed previously when coupling this beam into a \gls{smf} with a guiding mode very closely approximating the Gaussian \TEM{00} mode.

The light collected and collimated by the objective lens next passes through the ocular lens in the detection arm which focuses it into the \gls{smf}.
The image of the beam on the fiber end face is given by the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern generated by the wave (\cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efield:lens}) incident on the ocular lens aperture, which I give in \cref{sec:app:setup:optics:diffraction}.
The resulting diffraction pattern, \cref{eq:app:setup:optics:diffraction}, scaled with the radius $\rho$ is plotted in the middle panel of \cref{fig:setup:optics:coupling:modes_1d} together with the corresponding Airy disk result for a flattop beam (\cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:flattop:diffraction_pattern}) and the \gls{smf}'s guiding Gaussian mode.
The pattern of the flattop and the more accurate mode profile from \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efield:lens} are quite similar, but noticeably differ from the Gaussian mode at higher radii $\rho$.
The lower panel shows the fraction of power included in a circle of radius $\rho$, $P(\rho)\propto \int_0^{\rho}\dd{\rho^{\prime}} \rho^{\prime} I(\rho^{\prime})$, demonstrating that we can expect the mode matching to be fairly good.
Indeed, evaluating \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efficiency:mode_matching} for the light field ($E_{\mr{l}}$, \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efield:lens}) and the fiber's guiding mode ($E_{\mr{g}}$, \cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efield:tem00}), results in
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efficiency:mode_matching:eval}
    \eta_{\mr{m}}(E_{\mr{l}}, E_{\mr{g}})\approx\qty{83}{\percent}
\end{equation}
for our parameters, slightly better than the naive result using the flattop beam.
Together with the collection efficiency (\cref{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efficiency:collection}) and accounting for the transmittivity of the \gls{bs}, $T\approx\qty{87}{\percent}$,\sidenote{
    While the specifications of the beamsplitter are $T:R = \qty{90}{\percent}:\qty{10}{\percent}$, in reality $T:R\approx\qty{87}{\percent}:\qty{6}{\percent}$ which also varies slightly with polarization.
}
the \emph{optical efficiency}~\cite{Sze2007} from sample to fiber is thus
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup:optics:coupling:efficiency:optical}
    \eta_{\mr{o}} = T\eta_{\mr{c}}\eta_{\mr{m}}\approx\qty{1.0}{\percent}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Imaging the laser spot}\label{subsec:setup:optics:coupling:imaging}
As the confocal microscope is free space, we are in a position to image the sample using a white light source.
We can also, however, use the imaging capabilities to inspect the laser spot focused onto the sample and compare it to the behavior expected from \cref{subsec:setup:optics:coupling:lenses}.
